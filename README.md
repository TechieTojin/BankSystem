Bank Management System
Introduction
The Bank Management System is a Java-based application that simulates banking operations such as opening an account, checking balance, withdrawing, depositing money, and transferring money between accounts. This project provides a simplified interface for users to interact with their bank accounts, allowing them to perform basic banking activities.

Features
Account Creation: Users can open a new account by entering their name and an initial deposit (minimum of 500).
Account Access: Users can access their account using a unique account number and password.
Balance Check: Users can check their account balance.
Deposit: Users can deposit money into their account.
Withdraw: Users can withdraw money from their account (with conditions like maintaining a minimum balance).
Account Summary: Users can view a summary of their account details.
Money Transfer: (Not implemented yet in the current version, but it can be added).
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Java
IDE: Any Java IDE or Text Editor (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, Visual Studio Code)
Libraries: Standard Java libraries (no external libraries)
Folder Structure
The project is structured as follows:

bank_management_system/: Contains all the Java classes.
Accounts.java: Contains the logic for creating accounts and displaying account details.
ATM.java: Inherits from Accounts.java and handles operations like balance check, withdrawal, and deposit.
Bank.java: An interface that declares methods for account operations (e.g., openaccount, generatePassword).
Bank_Management_System.java: Main class with the user interface and application flow.
BankUser.java: Extends ATM and manages user interactions, such as entering passwords and accessing account details.
Setup Instructions
1. Clone or Download the Project
If you haven't already downloaded the project, you can either clone it from the repository or download it as a ZIP file and extract it.

2. Install Java
Ensure that you have Java installed on your system. If not, download and install the latest version of Java from the official website:

Download Java
3. Compile the Java Files
Once you have downloaded or cloned the project, open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory:

bash

cd C:\xampp\htdocs\BankSystem\bank_management_system
Then, compile the Java files:

bash

javac *.java
This will compile all the Java files in the directory.

4. Run the Program
To run the program, use the following command:

bash

java Bank_Management_System
5. Interacting with the Program
Upon running the program, the user will be presented with the following options:

markdown

Option:
1. Open a new Account
2. Access Bank Account
3. Transfer money to another Account
4. Exit
Option 1: Open a New Account
Users will be prompted to enter their name and initial deposit. If the deposit is less than 500, the account cannot be created.

Option 2: Access Bank Account
Users can access their account by entering their account number and password. Once authenticated, they can perform the following actions:

Check Balance
Withdraw Money (with balance checks)
Deposit Money
View Account Summary
Option 3: Transfer Money
This feature is currently not implemented, but you can extend the program to allow money transfer between accounts.

Option 4: Exit
Exit the program.

Classes Overview
Bank Interface

Declares methods like openaccount() and generatePassword() that must be implemented by any class that implements the Bank interface.
Accounts Class

Implements the Bank interface.
Handles account creation and management.
Generates random passwords for accounts.
ATM Class

Extends the Accounts class.
Contains methods for checking balance, withdrawing money, depositing money, and viewing account details.
BankUser Class

Extends the ATM class.
Handles user login with password validation.
Manages the main operations of the bank (e.g., deposit, withdraw).
Bank_Management_System Class

Main class of the application.
Handles the user interface and user input.
Possible Improvements
Money Transfer: Implement the money transfer functionality between different accounts.
GUI Interface: Create a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for a better user experience using JavaFX or Swing.
Database Integration: Integrate a database (like MySQL or SQLite) to store user information persistently instead of using in-memory data structures.
Conclusion
The Bank Management System is a simple console-based application that simulates basic banking operations using object-oriented principles in Java. It provides an interactive user interface for account management and basic operations like balance checking, withdrawal, and deposit.
